// object property that I chose in my actual data here in this file (setup:). However it's not always going to be the case that these are the same.
// If, for example, instead of "setup:" there will be "question:" then, over
// in App.js I will still say "setup=" because I'm the one that gets to choose what the prop name for my component is but then my actual data
// would need to change to "joke.question":      <Joke setup={joke.question} punchline = {joke.punchline}/> 
// and then I will need my punchline = {joke.punchline} again because the actual data has a "punchline" property in each of these "joke" objects

Challenge: Think critically - how would you pass in a prop that wasn't
a string datatype.

E.g. Say you want each Joke component to receive an "upvotes" and "downvotes"
prop that is a number, as well as a prop with an array of comments, and a boolean
of whether the joke is a pun (`isPun`).

        React can render the array of JSX elements. So that allow us to instead of hardcoding 
      our data directly into our components like we're did above, instead we can get data from outside of our little system,
      map over it and render a new component for every peace of data. In the next example we'll see how jokes.js file which has essentially
      the same thing as jokes.md but in the  JavaScript array of objects. Then we'll get all those in and map over them,
      create an array of JSX elements and then render those to the screen.
